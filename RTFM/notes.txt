taken from main.py (main program control loop)

# can python run the Makefile of a c++ app for us too?
# (or maybe do this in a bash script instead)

# requires that we know where the sensor is located
#sensorDir = '/home/pbeata/Research/FireMonitoring/SENSORS/3_RemoteRepoSSH/'

# requires this application be compiled first
#sensorName = 'SimpleSensor.exe'

should move busyEDM, etc. status to become a value held by LCM data structure
